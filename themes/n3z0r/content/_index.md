This is my personal blog where I post about my IT experiences and projects.
About me: Love problem solving, learning new things, and sharing my knowledge with others.
Tech Stuff: Windows (for work), Linux (for fun), macOS (for daily driving).
Engineer in heart, builder by nature. Getting my hands dirty with code, hardware, and everything in between.
